## User Stories:
 - As a music fan, I want to be able to look up local events happening in my area, so that I can create a wishlist of events I wish to attend
 - As a concert lover, I want to be able to see who is attending a nearby event in my area so that I can find potential groups of folks to go with and experience it together
 - As a hiring manager, I want to be able to see how your code can produce a working solution/product that solves a real-life problem so that I can potentially add you to my team of engineers.

## Reflection:

This is a 1 week long project built during my Unit 4 phase at General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive as a Fellow. Project goals included using all technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features to showcase a capstone project for graduation.  

## Next Steps:
- Fix pagination issue
- add mapbox API
- convert to TS
- integrate AWS services
